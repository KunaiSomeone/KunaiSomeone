Hello there :)
	My name's Kunai, but I usually use the aliases and usernames キアラ (Kiara), KiaraSomeone, KunaiSomeone, KiaraSmn or KunaiSmn on social media and game accounts.
*!!! Please do not call me Kiara though, as that's just an online signature and the name of one of my original characters*

  I speak Brazilian Portuguese and English fluently, and am learning Japanese and Spanish.

  I'm an artist, more specifically an illustrator and writer, still practicing animation.
  I am also interested in learning and have some knowledge in other arts such as editing, music, 3d modeling, programming and such, but am not as well taught or researched on those.

  I created this account to learn more programming and organize my projects related to it here! Mostly game mods and original art projects,, 
  All my knowledge with coding and programming comes from website source code customization; The Sims 4 custom content, mods and cheats; and Doki Doki Literature Club MAS submods.

Thank you for reading! Hope I'm not too annoying with questions :'))
